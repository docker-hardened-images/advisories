  ],
  "details": "### Impact\r\nAn authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to manipulate the garbage collector and potentially lead to remote code execution.\r\n\r\nThe problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThe problem is fixed in Redis 6.2.x, 7.2.x and 7.4.x.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nAn additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThe problem was reported by p33zy working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative\r\n",
