  "details": "### Summary\r\nEnvoy allows mixed-case schemes in HTTP/2, however, some internal scheme checks in Envoy are case-sensitive, leading to incorrect handling of requests and responses with mixed case schemes.\r\n\r\n### Affected component(s)\r\nHTTP and some related HTTP filters, like http/cache, OAuth2, and ssl redirect checks.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nEnvoy allows mixed-case schemes in HTTP/2, however, some internal scheme checks are case-sensitive, which can lead to the rejection of requests with mixed-case schemes such as `htTp` or `htTps`, or the bypassing of some requests such as `https` in unencrypted connections.\r\n\r\nWith this fix, Envoy will now lowercase scheme values by default, and change the internal scheme checks that were case-sensitive to be case-insensitive.\r\n\r\n### Attack vector(s)\r\nA HTTP request with mixed case scheme\r\n\r\n### PoC\r\nFor example, if a request with mixed scheme `htTp` is sent to the OAuth2 filter, it will fail the exact-match checks for `http`, and inform the remote endpoint the scheme is `https`, thus potentially bypassing OAuth2 checks specific to HTTP requests.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nBypass some requests with mixed schemes.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation\r\nNone\r\n\r\n",
