  "aliases": [
    "GHSA-4789-qfc9-5f9q"
  ],
  "details": "### Impact\r\nAn authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to manipulate the garbage collector, trigger a use-after-free and potentially lead to remote code execution.\r\n\r\nThe problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nAn additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThe problem was reported by Wiz researchers Benny Isaacs (@benny_isaacs), Nir Brakha, Sagi Tzadik (@sagitz_) working with Trend Micro, Zero Day Initiative\r\n",
