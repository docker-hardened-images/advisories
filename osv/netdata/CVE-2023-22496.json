  ],
  "details": "### Impact\r\n\r\nAn attacker with the ability to establish a streaming connection can execute arbitrary commands on the targeted Netdata agent.\r\n\r\nWhen an alert is triggered, the function `health_alarm_execute` is called. This function performs different checks and then enqueues a command by calling `spawn_enq_cmd`. This command is populated with several arguments that are not sanitized. One of them is the `registry_hostname` of the node for which the alert is raised. By providing a specially crafted `registry_hostname` as part of the health data that is streamed to a Netdata (parent) agent, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands at the remote host as a side-effect of the raised alert.\r\n\r\nNote that the commands are executed as the user running the Netdata Agent. This user is usually named `netdata`. The ability to run arbitrary commands may allow an attacker to escalate privileges by escalating other vulnerabilities in the system, as that user.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThe problem has been fixed in:\r\n\r\n    Netdata agent v1.37 (stable)\r\n    Netdata agent v1.36.0-409 (nightly)\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nStreaming is not enabled by default. If you have previously enabled this, it can be disabled by modifying `stream.conf`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[stream]\r\n    enabled = no\r\n```\r\n\r\nLimiting access to the port on the recipient Agent to trusted child connections may mitigate the impact of this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n- Documentation on [streaming and replication](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/streaming)\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [netdata/netdata](https://github.com/netdata/netdata)\r\n* Email us at [security@netdata.cloud](mailto:security@netdata.cloud)\r\n",
