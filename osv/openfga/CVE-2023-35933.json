  "details": "### Overview\r\n\r\nOpenFGA versions v1.1.0 and prior are vulnerable to a DoS attack when certain Check and ListObjects calls are executed against authorization models that contain circular relationship definitions.\r\n\r\n### Am I Affected?\r\n\r\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you are using OpenFGA v1.1.0 or earlier, and if you are executing certain [Check](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/Check) or [ListObjects](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects) calls against a vulnerable authorization model. To see which of your models could be vulnerable to this attack, download OpenFGA v1.2.0 and run the following command: \r\n\r\n```\r\n./openfga validate-models --datastore-engine \u003cENGINE\u003e --datastore-uri \u003cURI\u003e | jq .[] | select(.Error | contains(\"loop\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nreplacing the variables `\u003cENGINE\u003e` and `\u003cURI\u003e` as needed.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nUpgrade to v1.1.1.\r\n\r\n### Backward Compatibility\r\n\r\nIf you are not passing an invalid authorization model (as identified by running `./openfga validate-models`) as a parameter of your Check and ListObjects calls, this upgrade is backwards compatible. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, OpenFGA v1.1.1 will start returning HTTP 400 status codes on those calls.",
