  "details": "### Impact\r\n\r\nDenial of service (crash).\r\n\r\n### Affected components\r\n\r\nOauth2\r\n\r\n### Attack vector/s\r\n\r\nIf Envoy is running with the OAuth filter enabled exposed, a malicious actor could construct a request which would cause denial of service by crashing Envoy.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe OAuth filter assumes that a `state` query param is present on any response that looks like an OAuth redirect response. Sending it a request with the URI path equivalent to the redirect path, without the `state` parameter, will lead to abnormal termination of Envoy process.\r\n\r\n### Example exploit or proof-of-concept\r\n\r\nIf the redirect path looks like `/oauth_redirect`, sending a request to Envoy with the URI path `/oauth_redirect` and without specifying the `state` param will lead to a segmentation fault.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation\r\n\r\nThe issue can be mitigated by locking down OAuth traffic, disabling the filter or by filtering traffic before it reaches the OAuth filter (e.g. via a lua script). \r\n",
