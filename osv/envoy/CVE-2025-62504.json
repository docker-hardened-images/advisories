  "details": "### Summary\r\nWhen Lua directly returns an oversized response body exceeding the `per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes` (default 1MB), Envoy will crash directly.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nA Use-After-Free vulnerability exists in the Envoy proxy's Lua filter. The vulnerability is triggered when a Lua script, executing during the response phase, rewrites a response body to a size that exceeds the configured buffer watermark, resulting in a local reply. The direct local response headers will override the original response headers and result in all references of original response headers be dangling. \r\n\r\n### Mitigation\r\n* We can increase `per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes` to a large enough value to avoid it.\r\n* For HTTP2, we can set the `initial_stream_window_size` to a large enough value.\r\n* Because this problem happens at response phase, we can also set the `per_request_buffer_limit_bytes` or `request_body_buffer_limit` to a large enough value to avoid this problem.\r\n* The fix will be released in the latest version.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nDOS and crash\r\n",
