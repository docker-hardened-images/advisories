  ],
  "details": "### Impact\r\n\r\nThis is a collision attack on long IDs (64bits) for PGP keys.\r\n\r\nUsers of dependency verification in Gradle are vulnerable if they use long IDs for PGP keys in a `trusted-key` or `pgp` element in their [dependency verification metadata file](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_verification.html#sec:signature-verification).\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThe fix is to fail dependency verification if anything but a fingerprint is used in a trust element in dependency verification metadata.\r\n\r\nThe problem is fixed in Gradle 8.0 and above. The problem is also patched in Gradle 6.9.4 and 7.6.1.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nUsing only full fingerprint IDs for `trusted-key` or `pgp` element in the metadata is a protection against this issue.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n- [CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html)\r\n- [A Confusing Dependency](https://blog.autsoft.hu/a-confusing-dependency/)\r\n- [Dependency Confusion](https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610)\r\n\r\n### Questions?\r\n* For security related issues, please email us at security@gradle.com.\r\n* For non-security related issues, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/new/choose).\r\n",
