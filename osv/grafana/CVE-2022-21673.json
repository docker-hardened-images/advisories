  "id": "CVE-2022-21673",
  "aliases": [
    "GHSA-8wjh-59cw-9xh4"
  ],
  "details": "When a data source has the Forward OAuth Identity feature enabled, sending a query to that datasource with an API token (and no other user credentials) will forward the OAuth Identity of the most recently logged-in user.\r\n\r\nThis can allow API token holders to retrieve data for which they may not have intended access.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAll of the following must be true:\r\n* The Grafana instance has data sources that support the Forward OAuth Identity feature. Graphite users, for example.\r\n    * Some data sources are not susceptible, like Prometheus, as they do not have support for this feature.\r\n    * The option being available is not sufficient enough to determine if the data source is susceptible.\r\n* The Grafana instance has a data source with the Forward OAuth Identity feature toggled on.\r\n* The Grafana instance has OAuth enabled.\r\n* The Grafana instance has usable API keys.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThe following Grafana versions have been patched:\r\n* `v8.3.4`\r\n* `v7.5.13`\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nAdministrators of Grafana instances can limit the availability of API tokens.\r\n\r\n### Reporting security issues\r\n\r\nIf you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to security@grafana.com. This address can be used for all of Grafana Labs' open source and commercial products (including, but not limited to Grafana, Grafana Cloud, Grafana Enterprise, and grafana.com).
