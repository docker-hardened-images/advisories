  "aliases": [
    "NSWG-COR-50"
  ],
  "summary": "All versions of 9.x and later are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH. An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node process which provides an http server supporting TLS server to crash. This can be accomplished by sending duplicate/unexpected messages during the handshake. This vulnerability has been addressed by updating the TLS implementation. Thanks to Jordan Zebor at F5 Networks all of his help investigating this issue with the Node.js team.",
