  "details": "### Summary\r\n\r\nJWT filter will lead to an Envoy crash when clear route cache with remote JWKs.\r\n\r\n### Details and PoC\r\n\r\nFix an issue in JWT filter in the following case:\r\n\r\n* remote JWKs are used, which requires async header processing;\r\n* `clear_route_cache` is enabled on the provider;\r\n* header operations are enabled in JWT filter, e.g. header to claims feature;\r\n* the routing table is configured in a way that the JWT header operations modify requests to not match any route.\r\n\r\nWhen these conditions are met, a crash is triggered in the upstream code due to `nullptr` reference conversion from `route()`.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is the ordering of `continueDecoding` and `clearRouteCache`.\r\n\r\nWhen the above conditions are met, the following incorrect sequence occurs:\r\n\r\n* JWT filter pauses and then continues header decoding.\r\n* router filter picks a route and starts the upstream request.\r\n* JWT filter clears the route cache.\r\n* upstream request gets pool ready notifications and checks the route again for a setting, but the route is now missing.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nEnvoy crashes when JWT filter is used\r\n\r\n### Reporter\r\n\r\nAndreas Moreg√•rd (Andreas.Moregard@nordnet.se)",
