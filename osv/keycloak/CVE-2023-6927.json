  "details": "An incomplete fix was found in Keycloak Core patch. An attacker can steal authorization codes or tokens from clients using a wildcard in the JARM response mode \"form_post.jwt\". It is observed that changing the response_mode parameter in the original proof of concept from \"form_post\" to \"form_post.jwt\" can bypass the security patch implemented to address CVE-2023-6134.",
