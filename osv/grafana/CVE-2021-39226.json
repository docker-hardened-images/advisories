  "details": "Today we are releasing Grafana 7.5.11, and 8.1.6. These patch releases include an important security fix for an issue that affects all Grafana versions from 2.0.1.\r\n\r\n[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) instances have already been patched and an audit did not find any usage of this attack vector. [Grafana Enterprise](https://grafana.com/products/enterprise) customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo.\r\n\r\n8.1.5 contained a single fix for bar chart panels. We believe that users can expedite deployment by moving from 8.1.4 to 8.1.6 directly.\r\n\r\n## CVE-2021-39226 Snapshot authentication bypass\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nCVSS Score: 9.8 Critical\r\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nWe received a security report to [security@grafana.com](mailto:security@grafana.com) on 2021-09-15 about a vulnerability in Grafana regarding the snapshot feature. It was later identified as affecting Grafana versions from 2.0.1 to 8.1.6. [CVE-2021-39226](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-39226) has been assigned to this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nUnauthenticated and authenticated users are able to view the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths:\r\n\r\n* `/dashboard/snapshot/:key`, or\r\n* `/api/snapshots/:key`\r\n\r\nIf the snapshot \"public_mode\" configuration setting is set to true (vs default of false), unauthenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal path:\r\n\r\n* `/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey`\r\n\r\nRegardless of the snapshot \"public_mode\" setting, authenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths:\r\n\r\n* `/api/snapshots/:key`, or\r\n* `/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey`\r\n\r\nThe combination of deletion and viewing enables a complete walk through all snapshot data while resulting in complete snapshot data loss.\r\n\r\n### Attack audit\r\n\r\nWhile we can not guarantee that the below will identify all attacks, if you do find something with the below, you should consider doing a full assessment.\r\n\r\n#### Through reverse proxy/load balancer logs\r\n\r\nTo determine if your Grafana installation has been exploited for this vulnerability, search through your reverse proxy/load balancer access logs for instances where the path is `/dashboard/snapshot/:key`, `/api/snapshots/:key` or `/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey`, and the response status code was 200 (OK).\r\nFor example, if you’re using the Kubernetes ingress-nginx controller and sending logs to Loki, use a LogQL query like `{job=\"nginx-ingress-controller\"} |= \"\\\"status\\\": 200\" |= \"\\\"uri\\\": \\\"/api/snapshots/:key\\\"\"`.\r\n\r\n#### Through the Grafana Enterprise audit feature\r\n\r\nIf you enabled “Log web requests” in your configuration with `router_logging = true`, look for\r\n`\"requestUri\":\"/api/snapshots-delete/”`,`“requestUri\":\"/api/snapshots/:key\"`, or `\"type\":\"snapshot\"` in combination with `\"action\":\"delete\"`.\r\n\r\n### Patched versions\r\n\r\nRelease 8.1.6: \r\n\r\n- [Download Grafana 8.1.6](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/8.1.6)\r\n- [Release notes](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-8-1-6/)\r\n\r\nRelease 7.5.11: \r\n\r\n- [Download Grafana 7.5.11](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/7.5.11)\r\n- [Release notes](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-7-5-11/)\r\n\r\n### Solutions and mitigations\r\n\r\nDownload and install the appropriate patch for your version of Grafana.\r\n\r\n[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) instances have already been patched, and [Grafana Enterprise](https://grafana.com/products/enterprise) customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nIf for some reason you cannot upgrade:\r\n\r\nYou can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to the literal paths\r\n* `/api/snapshots/:key`\r\n* `/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey`\r\n* `/dashboard/snapshot/:key`\r\n* `/api/snapshots/:key`\r\n\r\nThey have no normal function and can be disabled without side effects.\r\n\r\n### Timeline and postmortem\r\n\r\nHere is a detailed timeline starting from when we originally learned of the issue. All times in UTC.\r\n\r\n* 2021-09-15 14:49: Tuan Tran theblackturtle0901@gmail.com sends initial report about viewing snapshots without authentication\r\n* 2021-09-15 15:56: Initial reproduction\r\n* 2021-09-15 17:10: MEDIUM severity declared\r\n* 2021-09-15 18:58: Workaround deployed on Grafana Cloud\r\n* 2021-09-15 19:15: `/api/snapshots/:key` found to be vulnerable as well\r\n* 2021-09-15 19:30: `/api/snapshots/:key` blocked on Grafana Cloud\r\n* 2021-09-16 09:31: `/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey` found to be vulnerable as well, blocked on Grafana Cloud. From this point forward, Cloud is not affected any more.\r\n* 2021-09-16 09:35: HIGH severity declared\r\n* 2021-09-16 11:19: Realization that combination of deletion and viewing allows enumeration and permanent DoS\r\n* 2021-09-16 11:19: CRITICAL declared\r\n* 2021-09-17 10:53: Determination that no weekend work is needed. While issue is CRITICAL, scope is very limited\r\n* 2021-09-17 14:26: Audit of Grafana Cloud concluded, no evidence of exploitation\r\n* 2021-09-23: Grafana Cloud instances updated\r\n* 2021-09-28 12:00: Grafana Enterprise images released to customers under embargo\r\n* 2021-10-05 17:00: Public release\r\n\r\n## Reporting security issues\r\n\r\nIf you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to [security@grafana.com](mailto:security@grafana.com).
