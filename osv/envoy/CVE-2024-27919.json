  "details": "### Summary\r\nEnvoy HTTP/2 protocol stack is vulnerable to memory exhaustion due to flood of CONTINUATION frames.\r\n\r\n### Affected Components\r\nHTTP/2 protocol stack.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nEnvoy's HTTP/2 codec does not reset a request when header map limits have been exceeded. This allows an attacker to send an sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing unlimited memory consumption.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nDenial of service through memory exhaustion.\r\n\r\n### Attack vector(s)\r\nSequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set, from an untrusted HTTP/2 peer.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nUsers should upgrade to versions 1.29.2 to mitigate the effects of the CONTINUATION flood.\r\nNote that this vulnerability is a regression in Envoy version 1.29.0 and 1.29.1 only.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nDowngrade to version 1.28.1 or earlier or disable HTTP/2 protocol.\r\n\r\n### Detection\r\nAbnormal process termination due to memory exhaustion. Memory profiles showing high memory consumption in HTTP/2 codec.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\nBartek Nowotarski  https://nowotarski.info/",
