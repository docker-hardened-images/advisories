  "details": "### Summary\r\n\r\nThe application uses WebSocket (with Socket.io), but it does not verify that the source of communication is valid. This allows third-party website to access the application on behalf of their client.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nWhen connecting to the server using Socket.IO, the server does not validate the `Origin` header leading to other site being able to open connections to the server and communicate with it.\r\n\r\nOther website still need to authenticate to access most features, however this can circumvent reverse proxy or firewall protections made in place by users deploying the application.\r\n\r\n### PoC\r\n\r\nOn another origin, you can serve the following HTML document.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"https://cdn.socket.io/4.7.2/socket.io.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script>\r\n        const socket = io(\"wss://[TARGET_WEBSITE]\", { transports: [\"websocket\"] });\r\n        socket.emit(\"getGameList\", console.log.bind(console))\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112879577/285227437-466b5120-7842-4890-8a36-ddfa95b425af.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWithout origin validation, Javascript executed from another origin would be allowed to connect to the application without any user interaction. Without login credentials, such a connection is unable to access protected endpoints containing sensitive data of the application. However, such a connection may allow attacker to further exploit unseen vulnerabilities of the application. \r\n\r\nUsers with \"No-auth\" mode configured who are relying on a reverse proxy or firewall to provide protection to the application would be especially vulnerable as it would grant the attacker full access to the application.\r\n\r\n### Remediation\r\n\r\nAdditional verification of the HTTP `Origin` header has been added to the socket.io connection handler. By default, if the `Origin` header is present, it would be checked against the `Host` header. Connection would be denied if the hostnames do not match, which would indicate that the request is cross-origin. Connection would be allowed if the `Origin` header is not present.\r\n\r\nUsers can override this behaviour by setting environment variable `UPTIME_KUMA_WS_ORIGIN_CHECK=bypass`.\r\n",
