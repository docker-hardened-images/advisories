  "summary": "Node.js is vulnerable to Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Hijacking under certain conditions on Windows platforms.\nThis vulnerability can be exploited if the victim has the following dependencies on a Windows machine:\n* OpenSSL has been installed and “C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\SSL\\openssl.cnf” exists.\n\nWhenever the above conditions are present, `node.exe` will search for `providers.dll` in the current user directory.\nAfter that, `node.exe` will try to search for `providers.dll` by the DLL Search Order in Windows.\n\nIt is possible for an attacker to place the malicious file `providers.dll` under a variety of paths and exploit this vulnerability.",
