  "details": "# Impact\r\n\r\nThere exists a potential header vulnerability in Traefik's handling of the Connection header. Active exploitation of this issue is unlikely, as it requires that a removed header would lead to a privilege escalation, however, the Traefik team has addressed this issue to prevent any potential abuse.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\nIf you have a chain of Traefik middlewares, and one of them sets a request header `Important-Security-Header`, then sending a request with the following Connection header will cause it to be removed before the request was sent:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl 'https://example.com' -H \"Connection: Important-Security-Header\" -0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the backend does not see the request header `Important-Security-Header`.\r\n\r\n# Patches\r\n\r\nTraefik v2.4.x: https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.4.13\r\n\r\n# Workarounds\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n# For more information\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, [open an issue](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues).\r\n",
