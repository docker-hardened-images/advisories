  "details": "### Impact\r\nThe directory support (#55) allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links.\r\n\r\nA well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. \r\n\r\nPrecisely, the following users of the affected versions are impacted:\r\n- `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`.\r\n- Go programs, which invokes `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThe problem has been patched by the PR linked with this advisory. Users should upgrade their `oras` CLI and packages to `0.9.0`.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nFor `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider.\r\n\r\nFor `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n- [Zip Slip](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability)\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/deislabs/oras)\r\n* Email the [list of maintainers](https://github.com/deislabs/oras/blob/main/MAINTAINERS)\r\n",
