  "details": "### Impact\r\nIncorrect log content. May affect network level RBAC for non-HTTP network connections.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen using proxy-protocol as a listener filter, tcp-proxy as the network filter, and access logging, the wrong downstream address is logged. The logged address should be the one from the proxy protocol header on the connection, but the direct peer address is logged instead.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n1.16.1\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### References\r\nhttps://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/14087\r\nhttps://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/14131\r\n",
