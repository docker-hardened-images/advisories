  "details": "## Vulnerability type\r\nUncontrolled Resource Consumption\r\n\r\n## Attack type\r\nRemote\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\nDenial-of-service, Resource consumption (memory) \r\n\r\n## Discoverer(s)/Credits\r\nWenlei (Frank) He (Google LLC)\r\nAntonio Vicente (Google LLC)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nEnvoy version 1.14.2, 1.13.2, 1.12.4 or older may consume excessive amounts of memory when proxying HTTP/2 requests or responses with many small (i.e. 1 byte) chunks. Envoy allocates a separate buffer fragment with the size rounded to the nearest 4Kb for each data frame that is written to the output buffer from the connection read-dispatch call stack. As such processing requests or responses with a lot of small chunks may result in extremely high memory overhead if the peer is slow or unable to read proxied data. The memory overhead could be one to two orders of magnitude more than configured buffer limits.",
