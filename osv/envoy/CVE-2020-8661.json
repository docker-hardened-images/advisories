In the case of illegally formed requests, Envoy sends an internally generated 400 error, which is sent to the Network::Connection buffer.  If the client reads these responses slowly, it is possible to build up a large number of responses, and consume functionally unlimited memory.  This bypasses Envoyâ€™s overload manager, which will itself send an internally generated response when Envoy approaches configured memory thresholds, exacerbating the problem.\r\n",
