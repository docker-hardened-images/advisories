Alongside with new features and other bug fixes, this release includes a Moderate severity security fix for CVE-2022-39229 \r\n\r\nWe are also releasing security patches for Grafana 9.1.8 and Grafana 8.5.14 to fix these issues.\r\n\r\nRelease 9.2, latest release, also containing security fix:\r\n\r\n- [Download Grafana 9.2](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/9.2)\r\n\r\nRelease 9.1.8, only containing security fix:\r\n\r\n- [Download Grafana 9.1.8](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/9.1.8)\r\n\r\nRelease 8.5.14, only containing security fix:\r\n\r\n- [Download Grafana 8.5.14](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/8.5.14)\r\n\r\nAppropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) and as always, we closely coordinated with all cloud providers licensed to offer Grafana Pro. They have received early notification under embargo and confirmed that their offerings are secure at the time of this announcement. This is applicable to Amazon Managed Grafana and Azure's Grafana as a service offering.\r\n\r\n## Improper authentication - CVE-2022-39229\r\n\r\n### Summary \r\n\r\nOn September 7 as a result of an internal security audit we have discovered a security vulnerability in Grafana basic authentication, related to the usage of username and email address. \r\n\r\nIn Grafana, a user’s username and email address are unique fields, that means no other user can have the same username or email address as another user. \r\n\r\nIn addition, a user can have an email address as a username and Grafana login allows users to sign in with either username or email address. This creates an unusual behavior, where _user_1_ can register with one email address and _user_2_ can register their username as _user_1_’s email address. As a result, _user_1_ would be prevented to sign in Grafana, since _user_1_ password won’t match with _users_2_ email address.\r\n\r\nThe CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.3 Moderate (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\r\n\r\n### Impacted versions\r\n\r\nAll installations for Grafana versions \u003c=9.x, \u003c=8.x\r\n\r\n### Solutions and mitigations\r\n\r\nTo fully address CVE-2022-39229 please upgrade your Grafana instances. \r\nAppropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud).\r\n\r\n## Reporting security issues\r\n\r\nIf you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to security@grafana.com.
