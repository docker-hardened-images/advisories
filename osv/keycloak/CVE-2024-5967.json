  ],
  "details": "### Impact\r\n\r\nThe LDAP testing endpoint allows to change the Connection URL independently of and without having to re-enter the currently configured LDAP bind credentials. An attacker with admin access (permission manage-realm) can change the LDAP host URL (\"Connection URL\") to a machine they control. The Keycloak server will connect to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials, thus leaking them to the attacker.\r\nAs a consequence, an attacker who has compromised the admin console/compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and can now attack the domain.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Simon Wessling for reporting this issue and helping us improve our project",
