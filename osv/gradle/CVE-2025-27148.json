  ],
  "details": "### Impact\r\n\r\nOn Unix-like systems, the system temporary directory can be created with open permissions that allow multiple users to create and delete files within it. Gradle builds could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory.\r\n\r\nGradle 8.12, only that exact version, had codepaths where the initialization of the underlying native integration library took a default path, relying on copying the binaries to the system temporary directory. Any execution of Gradle exposed this exploit.\r\n\r\nIf you are on Windows or modern versions of macOS, you are not vulnerable.\r\nIf you are on a Unix-like operating system with the [\"sticky\" bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit) set or [`noexec`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab#Options_common_to_all_filesystems) on your system temporary directory, you are not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis problem was [fixed in Gradle 8.12.1](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/32025). Gradle 8.13 release also upgrades to a version of the native library that no longer has that bug.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nOn Unix-like operating systems, ensure that the \"sticky\" bit is set. This only allows the original user (or root) to delete a file. Mounting `/tmp` as `noexec` will prevent Gradle 8.12 from starting.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to change the permissions of the system temporary directory, you can move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property java.io.tmpdir. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build user only.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n* [Root cause vulnerability in `native-platform`](https://github.com/gradle/native-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-2xxp-vw2f-p3x8)\r\n* Prior [Gradle vulnerability](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-89qm-pxvm-p336)\r\n\r\nMore about this type of vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\n* [CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/378.html)\r\n* [CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html)\r\n",
