  "details": "CVSS Score 6.1 [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L\u0026version=3.1), Medium\r\n\r\nSending a locally generated response must stop further processing of request or response data. Envoy tracks the amount of buffered request and response data and aborts the request if the amount of buffered data is over the limit by sending 413 or 500 responses. However when the buffer overflows while response is processed by the filter chain the operation may not be aborted correctly and result in accessing a freed memory block.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nDenial of Service\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nDisable filters that may modify a response body and increase its size if feasible.\r\n\r\n### References\r\nhttps://blog.envoyproxy.io\r\nhttps://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nOpen an issue in [Envoy repo](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues)\r\nEmail us at [envoy-security](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/envoy-security@googlegroups.com)\r\n\r\n",
