  "details": "### Impact\r\nThe `DEBUG` command has several potential security implications if used incorrectly or by unauthorized users. It exists mainly for advanced troubleshooting and by the Redis test suite.\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to block it using ACL configuration, this was not the default configuration before Redis 7.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThe problem is addressed in Redis versions 7.0, where the `DEBUG` command is blocked by default and can only be enabled by an administrator locally modifying a configuration file.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nIt is possible to mitigate this risk by using ACL to block users from using the `DEBUG` command.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThis problem was reported by Xion (SeungHyun Lee) of KAIST GoN.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [the Redis repository](https://github.com/redis/redis)\r\n* Email us at redis@redis.io\r\n",
