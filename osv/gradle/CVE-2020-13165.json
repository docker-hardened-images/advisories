  ],
  "details": "We want to thank [Marcin ZajÄ…czkowski](https://github.com/szpak) who originally reported this vulnerability to us.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nUsers that sign artifacts using the built-in [signing plugin with gpg-agent](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html#sec:using_gpg_agent) may be affected. If you do not sign your artifacts, you are not affected.\r\n\r\nAt `INFO` and `DEBUG` level logging, Gradle prints the full command-line of every executed process. When signing artifacts with gpg, Gradle executes the `gpg` or `gpg2` command-line tool and passes the passphrase for the private key as an argument. When `INFO` and `DEBUG` level logging is enabled, Gradle inadvertently logs the passphrase to the build log.\r\n\r\nUsers signing artifacts with gpg-agent are vulnerable with Gradle 4.5 through Gradle 6.4.x.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis behavior has been patched in Gradle 6.5.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nIf you are unable to upgrade, there are a few possible workarounds or mitigations:\r\n\r\n1. Check that your CI system is masking your passphrase from logs\r\n1. Check that your CI system is not using INFO or DEBUG level logging\r\n1. Use the [default Java implementation of PGP](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html#sec:signatory_credentials) to sign your artifacts instead of gpg-agent\r\n1. Fail the build if INFO or DEBUG level logging is used at the same time as signing\r\n\r\n#### Fail the build when signing with INFO or DEBUG level\r\n\r\nGroovy DSL:\r\n```\r\ngradle.taskGraph.whenReady { taskGraph -\u003e\r\n    if (taskGraph.allTasks.any { it instanceof Sign }) {\r\n        assert gradle.startParameter.logLevel \u003e LogLevel.INFO : \r\n            \"Signing tasks can't be used with INFO or DEBUG logging\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nKotlin DSL:\r\n```\r\ngradle.taskGraph.whenReady { \r\n    if (allTasks.any { task -\u003e task is Sign }) {\r\n        check(gradle.startParameter.logLevel \u003e LogLevel.INFO) { \r\n            \"Signing tasks can't be used with INFO or DEBUG logging.\" \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n* For security related issues, please email us at security@gradle.com.\r\n* For non-security related issues, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/new/choose).\r\n",
