  "details": "### Impact\r\nExtracting key names from a command and a list of arguments may, in some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap memory, heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. Several scenarios that may lead to this result:\r\n* Authenticated users executing a specially crafted `COMMAND GETKEYS` or `COMMAND GETKEYSANDFLAGS`.\r\n* Authenticated users who were set with ACL rules that match key names, executing a specially crafted command that refers to a variadic list of key names.\r\n\r\nThe problem exists in Redis 7.0 or newer.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThe problem is fixed in Redis 7.0.12.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThe problem was found by Lior Lahav.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [the Redis repository](https://github.com/redis/redis)\r\n* Email us at redis@redis.io",
