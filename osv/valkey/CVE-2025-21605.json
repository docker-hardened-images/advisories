  "details": "### Summary\r\nAn unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers, until the server runs out of memory or is killed.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nBy default, Valkey configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable.\r\n\r\nWhen password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from \"NOAUTH\" responses until the system will run out of memory.\r\n\r\nThe problem exists in all versions of Valkey.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nA workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the valkey executable is to block access to limit the output buffer limit, with `client-output-buffer-limit normal \u003chard limit\u003e \u003csoft limit\u003e \u003csoft seconds\u003e`.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThe problem was reported by Tiezhen Zhang([zhangtiezhen@huawei.com](mailto:zhangtiezhen@huawei.com)) and Hanyang Jin([jinhanyang@huawei.com](mailto:jinhanyang@huawei.com)).",
