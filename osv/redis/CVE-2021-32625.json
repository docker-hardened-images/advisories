  "details": "### Impact\r\nAn integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer, could be exploited using the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution.\r\n\r\nThis is a result of an incomplete fix by CVE-2021-29477.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThe problem is fixed in version 6.2.4 and 6.0.14.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nAn additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to use ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the `STRALGO LCS` command.\r\n\r\nOn 64 bit systems which have the fixes of CVE-2021-29477 (6.2.3 or 6.0.13), it is sufficient to make sure that the `proto-max-bulk-len` config parameter is smaller than 2GB (default is 512MB).\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThis problem has been identified and reported by Nipun Gupta.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [the Redis repository](https://github.com/redis/redis)\r\n* Email us at redis@redis.io\r\n",
