  "details": "Affected versions\r\n1.0.0-1.3.6 and 2.0.0-2.3.0\r\n\r\nPatched versions\r\nOpenSearch 2.4.0 and 1.3.7\r\n\r\nImpact\r\nOpenSearch allows users to specify a local file when defining text analyzers to process data for text analysis. An issue in the implementation of this feature allows certain specially crafted queries to return a response containing the first line of text from arbitrary files. The list of potentially impacted files is limited to text files with read permissions allowed in the Java Security Manager policy configuration.\r\n\r\nPatches\r\nOpenSearch version 1.3.7 and 2.4.0 contain a fix for this issue.\r\n\r\nFor more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please contact AWS/Amazon Security via our issue reporting page (https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/) or directly via email to aws-security@amazon.com. Please do not create a public GitHub issue.\r\n",
