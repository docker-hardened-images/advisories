Run the latest version of the louislam/uptime-kuma container and initialize the account password.\r\n2. Create a new status page.\r\n3. Edit the status page and change the Google Analytics ID to following payload(it only works for firefox. Any attribute can be injected, but this seems the most intuitive):\r\n```\r\n123123\" onafterscriptexecute=alert(window.name+1),eval(window.name) a=\"x\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Click Save and return to the interface. XSS occurs.\r\nscreenshots:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110759348/282287393-4874974f-9416-4941-9c2e-a92ee2412197.png)\r\n\r\n![9d0603e634fb7da2e83a0a45dc0a36ac](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110759348/282287346-1deb0382-520f-47cf-b191-9b7d19c47879.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
