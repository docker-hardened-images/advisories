  "aliases": [

  ],
  "details": "### Impact\r\nSpecially crafted Lua scripts executing in Redis can cause the heap-based Lua stack to be overflowed, due to incomplete checks for this condition. This can result with heap corruption and potentially remote code execution.\r\n\r\nThis problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThe problem is fixed in versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nAn additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict `EVAL` and `EVALSHA` commands.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThis problem was identified by Meir Shpilraien.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [the Redis repository](https://github.com/redis/redis)\r\n* Email us at redis@redis.io\r\n",
