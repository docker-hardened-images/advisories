  "aliases": [
    "GHSA-66gq-c942-6976"
  ],
  "details": "### Impact\r\nAuthenticated users can trigger a denial-of-service by using specially crafted, long string match patterns on supported commands such as `KEYS`, `SCAN`, `PSUBSCRIBE`, `FUNCTION LIST`, `COMMAND LIST` and ACL definitions. Matching of extremely long patterns may result in unbounded recursion, leading to stack overflow and process crash.\r\n\r\nThe problem affects all versions of Redis.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThe problem is fixed in Redis 6.2.16, 7.2.6, and 7.4.1.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThe problem was reported by [tomistripping](https://github.com/tomistripping).\r\n",
