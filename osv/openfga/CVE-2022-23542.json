  "details": "### Overview\r\nDuring our internal security assessment, it was discovered that OpenFGA versions v0.3.0 is vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions.\r\n\r\n### Am I Affected?\r\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if **all** of the following applies:\r\n\r\n1.  You are using OpenFGA v0.3.0\r\n2. You created a model using modeling language v1.1 that applies a type restriction to an object e.g. `define viewer: [user]`\r\n3. You created tuples based on the aforementioned model, e.g. `document:1#viewer@user:jon`\r\n4. You updated the previous model by adding a new type and replacing the previous restriction with the newly added type e.g. `define viewer: [employee]`\r\n5. You use the tuples created against the first model (step 3) and issue checks against the updated model e.g. `user=user:jon, relation=viewer, object:document:1`\r\n\r\n### How to fix that?\r\nUpgrade to version v0.3.1\r\n\r\n### Backward Compatibility\r\nThis update is backward compatible.",
