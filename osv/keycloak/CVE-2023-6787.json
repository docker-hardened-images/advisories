  "aliases": [

  "details": "A flaw was found in Keycloak. An active keycloak session can be hijacked by initiating a new authentication (having the query parameter prompt=login) and forcing the user to enter his credentials once again. If the user cancels this re-authentication by clicking Restart login, the account takeover could take place as the new session, with a different SUB, will have the same SID as the previous session.\r\n\r\n",
