  "details": "### Overview\r\nDuring our internal security assessment, it was discovered that OpenFGA versions `v0.2.3` and prior are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions.\r\n\r\n### Am I Affected?\r\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `openfga/openfga` version `v0.2.3` or prior, and your model has a relation defined as a tupleset (the right hand side of a ‘from’ statement) that involves anything other than a direct relationship (e.g. ‘as self’)\r\n\r\n### How to fix that?\r\nUpgrade to version `v0.2.4`.\r\n\r\n### Backward Compatibility\r\nThis update is not backward compatible.\r\nAny model involving rewritten tupleset relations will no longer be acceptable and has to be modified.\r\n  ",
