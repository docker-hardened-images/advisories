  "details": "### Brief Description\r\nOn a TLS connection, if a TLS alert is received, Envoy tries to get a textual description of the alert code. For unknown codes, a NULL pointer is dereferenced resulting in Envoy crashing.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not applicable to 1.15 and earlier due to the fact that on those releases, Envoy did not use C++17, and used the Abseil version of string_view, absl::string_view. When the project switched to C++17, Abseil internally started using std::string_view, which does not handle nullptr in the constructor. Thus, this issue only applies to versions using C++17.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nDenial of Service.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### References\r\nhttps://blog.envoyproxy.io\r\nhttps://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases\r\n\r\n### Attack vector(s)\r\nNetwork.\r\n",
