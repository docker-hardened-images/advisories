  "summary": "Upgrade npm to fixes a security flaw in the use of\nauthentication tokens in HTTP requests that would allow an attacker to set up a\nserver that could collect tokens from users of the command-line interface.\nAuthentication tokens have previously been sent with every request made by the\nCLI for logged-in users, regardless of the destination of the request. This\nupdate fixes this by only including those tokens for requests made against the\nregistry or registries used for the current install.\n\nThis is a flaw in the version of npm included with node.\n\nnpm is updated to 3.8.3 in node 5.10.1, and to 2.15.1 in node 4.4.2.\n\n",
