Envoy allocates a separate buffer fragment for each incoming or outgoing chunk with the size rounded to the nearest 4Kb and does not release empty chunks after committing data. As such processing requests or responses with a lot of small chunks may result in extremely high memory overhead while proxying. The memory overhead could be two to three orders of magnitude more than configured buffer limits.\r\n",
