  "details": "### Impact\r\nAn integer overflow bug in Redis 5.0 or newer can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` and `client-query-buffer-limit` configuration parameters to very large values and constructing specially crafted very large stream elements.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThe problem is fixed in Redis 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nAn additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the `CONFIG SET` command.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThis issue was discovered and reported by [sundb](https://github.com/sundb).\r\n\r\n### References\r\nAn additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter.
