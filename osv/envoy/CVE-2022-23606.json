  "details": "CVSS Score 4.4 AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, Medium\r\n\r\nWhen a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nInfinite recursion causes Envoy crash.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nReduce the maximum number of connections in the cluster circuit breaker, considering that the 8Mb stack (default size on Linux) can only handle disconnecting less than 2K connections.\r\n\r\n### References\r\nhttps://blog.envoyproxy.io\r\nhttps://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nOpen an issue in [Envoy repo](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues)\r\nEmail us at [envoy-security](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/envoy-security@googlegroups.com)\r\n",
