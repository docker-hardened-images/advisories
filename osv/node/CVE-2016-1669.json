  "summary": "Under certain conditions, V8 may improperly expand memory allocations in the\nZone::New function. This could potentially be used to cause a Denial of Service\nvia buffer overflow or as a trigger for a remote code execution.\n\nAlthough this bug is marked as high severity in the corresponding Chromium\nrelease (50.0.2661.102), our assessment is that this is low severity for\nNode.js users due to the level of difficulty in making use of this\nvulnerability. However, users are encouraged to upgrade their Node.js\ninstallation to ensure they are properly protected.\n\n",
