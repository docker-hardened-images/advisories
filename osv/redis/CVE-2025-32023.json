  ],
  "details": "### Impact\r\nAn authenticated user may use a specially crafted string to trigger a stack/heap out of bounds write on hyperloglog operations, potentially leading to remote code execution.\r\n\r\nThe bug likely affects all Redis versions with hyperloglog operations implemented.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nAn additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing hyperloglog operations. This can be done using ACL to restrict HLL commands.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nSeunghyun Lee (@0x10n) of CMU PPP, as part of PlaidCTF 2025\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [the Redis repository](https://github.com/redis/redis)\r\n* Email us at redis@redis.io",
