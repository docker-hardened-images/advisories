  "details": "### Impact\r\nAn attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua script can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result with a crash of the redis-server process. This issue affects all versions of Redis.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThe problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nAn additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThis problem has been reported by Aviv Yahav.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [the Redis repository](https://github.com/redis/redis)\r\n* Email us at redis@redis.io",
