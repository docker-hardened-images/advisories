  "details": "## Overview\r\nOpenFGA is vulnerable to a DoS attack. In some scenarios that depend on the model and tuples used, a call to ListObjects may not  release memory properly. So when a sufficiently high number of those calls are executed, the OpenFGA server can create an \"out of memory\" error and terminate.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\nUpgrade to v1.4.3. This upgrade is backwards compatible.",
