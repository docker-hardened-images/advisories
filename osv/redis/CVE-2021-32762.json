  ],
  "details": "### Impact\r\nThe `redis-cli` command line tool and `redis-sentinel` service may be vulnerable to integer overflow when parsing specially crafted large multi-bulk network replies. This is a result of a vulnerability in the underlying `hiredis` library which does not perform an overflow check before calling the `calloc()` heap allocation function.\r\n\r\nThis issue only impacts systems with heap allocators that do not perform their own overflow checks. Most modern systems do and are therefore not likely to be affected. Furthermore, by default `redis-sentinel` uses the `jemalloc` allocator which is also not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThe problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThis issue was discovered and reported by Microsoft Vulnerability Research.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [the Redis repository](https://github.com/redis/redis)\r\n* Email us at redis@redis.io\r\n",
