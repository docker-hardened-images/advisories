  "details": "Our team would like to thank Fahimhusain Raydurg for [responsibly disclosing](https://www.rabbitmq.com/contact.html#security)\r\nthis vulnerability and Patrik Ragnarsson from CloudAMQP for contributing a fix.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWhen a federation link was displayed in the RabbitMQ management UI via the `rabbitmq_federation_management` plugin,\r\nits consumer tag was rendered without proper \u003cscript\u003e tag sanitization, potentially allowing for JavaScript code\r\nexecution in the context of the page.\r\n\r\nThe user must be signed in and have elevated permissions (manage federation upstreams and policies).\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\n * The vulnerability is patched in RabbitMQ 3.8.18 or a later version.\r\n * https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3122\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nDisable the `rabbitmq_federation_management` plugin and use [CLI tools](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html) instead.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please contact `security@rabbitmq.com`.",
