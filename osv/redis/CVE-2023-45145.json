  "details": "### Impact\r\nOn startup, Redis begins listening on a Unix socket before adjusting its permissions to the user-provided configuration. If a permissive umask(2) is used, this creates a race condition that enables, during a short period of time, another process to establish an otherwise unauthorized connection.\r\n\r\nThe problem exists since Redis 2.6.0-RC1.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThe problem is fixed in Redis 7.2.2, 7.0.14 or 6.2.14.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nIt is possible to work around the problem by disabling Unix sockets, starting Redis with a restrictive umask, or storing the Unix socket file in a protected directory.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThe problem was reported by Alexander Aleksandroviƒç Klimov of Icinga.",
