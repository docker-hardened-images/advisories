  ],
  "summary": "Due to the formatting logic of the console.table() function it was not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the properties parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least one property as the first parameter, which could be __proto__. The prototype pollution has very limited control, in that it only allows an empty string to be assigned to numerical keys of the object prototype. See https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-21824 for more details.",
