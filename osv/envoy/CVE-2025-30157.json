  "details": "### Summary\r\nEnvoy's ext_proc HTTP filter is at risk of crashing if a local reply is sent to the external server due to the filter's life time issue. A known situation is the fail of a websocket handshake will trigger a local reply leading to the crash of Envoy.\r\n\r\n### PoC\r\nIf both websocket and ext_proc are enabled, a failed handshake will trigger a local reply, thus ext_proc will crash.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation\r\n1. Disable websocket traffic\r\n2. Change the websocket response from backend to always return `101 Switch protocol` based on RFC.\r\n3. Apply the patch and the ext_proc filter will not send the local reply that is generated by Envoy to the ext_proc server for processing.\r\n4. Apply the patch that the router will cancel the upstream requests when sending a local reply.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nDenial of service\r\n\r\n### Reporter\r\nVasilios Syrakis\r\nFernando Cainelli\r\n",
