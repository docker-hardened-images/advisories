  "details": "### Summary\r\n\r\nEnvoy exposed an out-of-memory (OOM) vector from the mirror response, since async HTTP client will buffer the response with an unbounded buffer.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nIf a mirror cluster decides to send extremely large response messages, those messages are fully buffered in memory by the async HTTP client. This allows a malicious backend to potentially OOM Envoys by sending huge responses. \r\n\r\nOther components that are using HTTP async client in Envoy may also be impacted.\r\n\r\n- wasm filter\r\n- lua filter\r\n- ext_proc\r\n- oauth fitler\r\n- ext_authz\r\n- jwks_fetcher\r\n- gcp_auther_filter\r\n- aws_metadata_fetcher\r\n- opentelemetry/http_trace_exporter,\r\n- opentelemetry/dynatrace/sampler_config_provider\r\n- config_subscription/rest/rest_api_fetcher\r\n- rate_limiter\r\n\r\nMost of the auth/log related extensions assume trusted upstream, while wasm, lua, and ext_proc may not assume it.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nDenial of service and Envoy will be OOMed.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation\r\n\r\nPatched versions:\r\n* disable buffering the mirror response, as Envoy will never use it.\r\n* provide a configuration for the HTTP async client with a default hard limit. Users can set the limit through a runtime key based on needs, protection mechanism, security posture, etc.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\n\r\nReported by: Paul Ogilby \u003cpaul.robert.gallagher@gmail.com\u003e (@paul-r-gall)\r\n",
