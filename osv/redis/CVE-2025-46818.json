  "details": "### Impact\r\nAn authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to manipulate different LUA objects and potentially run their own\r\ncode in the context of another user\r\n\r\nThe problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nAn additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to block a script by restricting both the EVAL and FUNCTION command families.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThe problem was reported by zhutyra\r\n",
