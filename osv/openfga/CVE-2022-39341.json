  "details": "### Overview\r\nDuring our internal security assessment, it was discovered that OpenFGA versions `v0.2.3` and prior are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions.\r\n\r\n### Am I affected?\r\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `openfga/openfga` version `v0.2.3` and you added a tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a tupleset relation (the right hand side of a ‘from’ statement).\r\n\r\n### How to fix that?\r\nUpgrade to version `v0.2.4`.\r\n\r\n### Backward Compatibility\r\nThis update is not backward compatible with any authorization model that uses wildcard on a tupleset relation.\r\n\r\n",
