  "summary": "HTTP2 'unknownProtocol' cause Denial of Service by resource exhaustion - Affected Node.js versions are vulnerable to denial of service attacks when too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' are established. This leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the system, then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then this lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the system to run out of memory.",
