  "details": "### Impact\r\n\r\nFiles created with open permissions in the system temporary directory can allow an attacker to access information downloaded by Gradle. Some builds could be vulnerable to a local information disclosure.\r\n\r\nRemote files accessed through [`TextResourceFactory`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.resources.TextResourceFactory.html) are downloaded into the system temporary directory first. Sensitive information contained in these files can be exposed to other local users on the same system.\r\n\r\nIf you do not use the `TextResourceFactory` API, you are not vulnerable. \r\n\r\n### What should you do? \r\n\r\n### Upgrade to Gradle 7.0\r\n\r\nAs of Gradle 7.0, uses of the system temporary directory have been moved to the Gradle User Home directory. By default, this directory is restricted to the user running the build. \r\n\r\n#### Workarounds for older versions\r\n\r\nSet a more restrictive [umask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) that removes read access to other users. When files are created in the system temporary directory, they will not be accessible to other users. \r\n\r\nIf you are unable to change your system's umask, you can move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property `java.io.tmpdir`. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build user only.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n- Vulnerable code: https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/ad8c7c993bda8c2660ddd36584b2d2a035cc2e8c/subprojects/core/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/internal/resources/ApiTextResourceAdapter.java#L65-L72 \r\n- [CWE-377: Insecure Temporary File](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/377.html)\r\n\r\n### Questions?\r\n\r\n* For security related issues, please email us at security@gradle.com.\r\n* For non-security related issues, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/new/choose).\r\n",
