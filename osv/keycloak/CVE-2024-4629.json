  "aliases": [

  "details": "If an attacker launches many login attempts in parallel then the attacker can have more guesses at a password than the brute force protection configuration permits. This is due to the brute force check occurring before the brute force protector has locked the user.\r\n\r\n**Acknowledgements:**\r\nSpecial thanks to Maurizio Agazzini for reporting this issue and helping us improve our project.",
