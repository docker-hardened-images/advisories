  "details": "### Impact Summary\r\n\r\nA sophisticated attack that could modify virtual host name on disk and then make it unrecoverable (with\r\nother on disk file modifications) can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the browsers of management UI users.\r\n\r\n[Detailed CVSS 3.1 score](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L/E:P/RL:O/RC:C\u0026version=3.1): 5.5 overall.\r\n\r\nThis attack was responsibly disclosed by a team of security researchers at [Best of the Best](https://en.kitribob.kr/) ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nWhen a [virtual host](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/vhosts) on a RabbitMQ node fails to start, recent versions\r\nwill display an error message (a notification) in the management UI. The error message includes virtual host name,\r\nwhich was not escaped prior to open source RabbitMQ 4.0.3 and Tanzu RabbitMQ 4.0.3, 3.13.8.\r\n\r\nAn attack that both\r\n\r\n1. Makes a virtual host fail to start, and\r\n2. Creates a new virtual host name with an XSS code snippet or changes the name of an existing virtual host on disk\r\n\r\ncould trigger arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the management UI (the user's browser).\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nOpen source RabbitMQ `4.0.3`.\r\nTanzu RabbitMQ `4.0.3` and `3.13.8`.\r\n\r\nNote that any future open source RabbitMQ `3.13.x` releases [will only be available to paying customers](https://www.rabbitmq.com/release-information). All other users should [upgrade](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/upgrade) to `4.0.x`.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nDisable the management plugin and use [Prometheus and Grafana](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/prometheus) for monitoring\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability was researched and responsibly disclosed by a team at [Best of the Best](https://en.kitribob.kr/) ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·\r\n\r\n* Dain Lee @GodDa-In\r\n* Eojin Lee @itsme-connected\r\n* WooJin Park @jin-156\r\n* MinJung Lee @PlppIle\r\n* SeChang Oh @osc010524",
