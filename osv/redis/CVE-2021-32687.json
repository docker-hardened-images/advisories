  ],
  "details": "### Impact\r\nAn integer overflow bug affecting all versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially be used to leak arbitrary contents of the heap or trigger remote code execution.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability involves changing the default `set-max-intset-entries` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands to manipulate sets.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThe problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nAn additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `set-max-intset-entries` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThis issue was discovered and reported by Pawel Wieczorkiewicz (Amazon Web Services).\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [the Redis repository](https://github.com/redis/redis)\r\n* Email us at redis@redis.io\r\n",
