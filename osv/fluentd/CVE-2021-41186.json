  "details": "### Impact\r\nparser_apache2 plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nv1.14.2\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nEither of the following:\r\n\r\n* Don't use parser_apache2 for parsing logs which cannot guarantee generated by Apache.\r\n* Put patched version of parser_apache2.rb into /etc/fluent/plugin  directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd).\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* [CVE-2021-41186](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41186)\r\n* [GHSA-hwhf-64mh-r662](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/security/advisories/GHSA-hwhf-64mh-r662)\r\n* [GHSL-2021-102](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2021-102-fluent-fluentd/)\r\n* https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1142\r\n",
