They have received early notification under embargo and confirmed that their offerings are secure at the time of this announcement. This is applicable to Amazon Managed Grafana.\r\n\r\n### Timeline\r\n\r\nHere is a detailed timeline starting from when we originally learned of the issue. All times in UTC.\r\n\r\n2022-06-27 19:00 - Research submission of vulnerability report\r\n2022-06-27 20:53 - Issue triaged, confirmed positive, and internal incident raised\r\n2022-06-28 08:42 - Fix PR submitted and reviewed\r\n2022-06-28 20:58 - All Grafana Cloud hosted Grafana instances patched\r\n2022-07-05 07:14 - Customers informed under embargo\r\n2022-07-14 02:00 - Public release\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank the HTTPVoid team for responsibly disclosing the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### Reporting security issues\r\n\r\nIf you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to security@grafana.com.
