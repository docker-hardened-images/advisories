  "details": "### Impact\r\nWhen validating TLS certificates, Envoy would incorrectly allow a wildcard DNS Subject Alternative Name apply to multiple subdomains. For example, with a SAN of `*.example.com`, Envoy would incorrectly allow `nested.subdomain.example.com`, when it should only allow `subdomain.example.com`. \r\n\r\nThis defect applies to both validating a client TLS certificate in mTLS, and validating a server TLS certificate for upstream connections.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is only applicable to situations where an untrusted entity can obtain a signed wildcard TLS certificate for a domain of which you only intend to trust a subdomain of. For example, if you intend to trust `api.mysubdomain.example.com`, and an untrusted actor can obtain a signed TLS certificate for `*.example.com` or `*.com`.\r\n\r\nConfigurations are vulnerable if they use `verify_subject_alt_name` in any Envoy version, or if they use `match_subject_alt_names` in version 1.14 or later.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThis issue has been fixed in Envoy versions 1.15.0, 1.14.4, 1.13.4, 1.12.6.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### References\r\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#section-6.4.3\r\n",
