  "details": "### Impact\r\nOn 32-bit versions, Redis BITFIELD command is vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves constructing specially crafted bit commands which overflow the bit offset.\r\n\r\n**This problem only affects 32-bit versions of Redis.**\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThe problem is fixed in Redis 6.2.5, 6.0.15, 5.0.13.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nAn additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from using the BITFIELD command. This can be done using ACL in Redis 6.0 and above.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThis issue was discovered and reported by Huang Zhw.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [the Redis repository](https://github.com/redis/redis)\r\n* Email us at redis@redis.io\r\n",
